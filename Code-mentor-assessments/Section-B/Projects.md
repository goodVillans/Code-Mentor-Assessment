# Section B: Projects

The Project I am most certainly proud of was My Final Capstone Project In which our assignment was to create a MERN stack application for credential management.

## Insights

- Huge improvements in approach to application design were learnt in the process(A first for me in terms of how feature-rich the requirements were).
- Solidified my understanding of general concepts within the bounds of the learning materials provided by Hyperion Dev.
- Broadend my understanding of concepts such as creation of custom middleware and business logic and how it is implemented within best practice backend infrastructure.
- use of multiple dependencies as a means of optimising security measures.
- database design best practice to ensure solidified data integrity while allowing for its manipulation in client-side envirnments.
- Solidified knowledge of React concepts such as global state, dispatcher functionality and custom hooks.
