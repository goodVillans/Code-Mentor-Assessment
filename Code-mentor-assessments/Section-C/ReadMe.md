# Dijkstra's Algorithm Project

*This repository contains an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the problem of shortest path between two node in an undirected graph.*

In this code, the distances, previous, and visited all store data related to each vertex, contributing to **a worst case  space complexity of O(|V|).**

and the While loop in the dijkstra function, which continues until all nodes are visited, and the for loop within it, which iterates through all edges for each node, together contribute to the **O(|E| + |V| log |V|) time complexity.**

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

**1. Clone the repository to your local machine:**

git clone:  <https://github.com/username/repository.git>

**2. Navigate to the project directory:**

cd into Section-C folder

**3: Install the dependencies:**

npm install

### Running Tests

write 'npm test' to run tests once node-modules are installed.
