# Section D: Mentorship

The Problem sets *I have Opted to complete are the First and Third Cases*.

## Option 1: Student Progress

The Intervention plan for each of the struggling groups could entail a number of different facets:

### For the 5 lagging students

- **Individual Mentorship:** Meet with each of these students individually to identify the challenges they are facing. This could range from personal problems to difficulty understanding course material. It's important to have an open, empathetic conversation to understand their unique situations.

- **Pseudocode Evaluation and Poetential Reiteration:** Often, the source of lack of comprehension any given problem stems from an incomplete understanding of how the problem is to be solved before there is an attempt to solve the problem. If through individual mentorship i change gauge that the student does not understand the proverbial "whys, whats, hows" of the problem/s a assisted reiteration of the psudo problem would be an option.

- **Personalized Catch-up Plan:** Based on the challenges identified, create a personalized catch-up plan for each student. This should include a timeline with achievable milestones, extra study materials, and links to relevant resources.

- **Frequent Check-ins:** Regularly schedule check-ins (at least once a week) to monitor their progress, provide feedback and guidance, and make adjustments to their plan as necessary.

### For the 10 Students at risk of Falling behind

All of the above Interventions could be used in this case, aswell as:

- **Curated learning content:** Based on the knowledge gaps identified throughout the course of the one on one mentoring sessions i would curate a list of resource materials that help each learner fill those learning gaps and/or comprehension on the subject.

- **Preventive Action Plan:** I would provide a plan that includes strategies for time management, study tips for the topic in focus(namely programming), and how to effectively ask for help when needed(As a falling behind of this magnitude can often be attributed to an individuals irrational fears to ask for help when help is needed).

- **Mentor Pairing:** If resources permit, I would propose pairing these students with mentors (could be the students who are ahead?) to guide them through the next task(withour blatantly giving answer) and help keep them on track. This may also be an opportunity to workshop the capabilities/potential for new coding mentors candidates on completion of studies but students that are ahead would not be required to fufill this role as it may effect their own studies.

- **Simple Due date reminders:** This wont just be a "notification" of sorts but, a potential reminder to always reach out for help when struggling, along with encouragement that they have made it thus far and need to have enough faith in themselves to know that they can accomplish anything they set their mind to.

### For the Students that are ahead

- **Identify Potential Concerns:** Before making any assumptions of what may be the best course of action to mitigate for any potential hinderences of the students, it is important to hear each of these students out and find out if they arre feeling halted in any manner by their lacking peers. this would allow for action of the most appropriate manner.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Regularly check-in and provide feedback on their progress. Encourage them to maintain their pace but also ensure they understand the concepts deeply and are not just rushing through the tasks.
- **Recognition:** Acknowledge their hard work and progress. Positive reinforcement can boost morale and maintain their momentum.

## Case 3: Student Feedback

Ths Process I would generally follow had I ever recieved a complaint of this nature would be to this effect:

### Self-Evaluation

Before responding, I'd review the feedback I provided. Did I articulate my points clearly and effectively? Was my feedback indeed actionable and personalized? This introspection helps me understand if there was any shortcoming from my side.

### Respond Calmly and Professionally

I would respond to the student in a professional and calm manner. I'd validate their feelings and let them know I understand their frustration. It's important to show empathy and respect their perspective.

### Explain Your Intent

I would briefly explain my intentions and process when providing feedback to reassure them that my intention was to help them improve.

### Discuss Specifics

I would urge the student to provide specific examples of times when they felt the criticism was general or unhelpful. This demonstrates that I am concerned about their concerns, and it also assists me in determining the source of the disconnect.

**An example response to the aggrievement** might be:

*I understand that you're frustrated with the feedback you received on your recent submission. It's important to me that you find my feedback valuable and helpful, and I'm sorry if this wasn't the case this time.*

*My aim is to provide you with specific, actionable feedback that helps you grow as a developer. I take the time to review your code in detail and try to tailor my feedback to your unique situation.*

*Could you please point me to the specific areas of feedback that you felt were generic or did not provide value? It will help me understand your perspective better and improve my future feedback.*

### Request a Meeting

Depending on the severity of the situation and the response of the student, I might request a one-on-one meeting to discuss the feedback in more depth. This allows for a more open and personal conversation, and it can be easier to resolve misunderstandings in a live discussion.

### Addressing Social Media Complaint

As for the social media complaint, I'd report it to the appropriate higher-ups or department within the organization. It would be their responsibility to respond publicly, if needed, in a way that protects the institution's reputation while still addressing the student's concerns.
